# Dunbar Cybersecurity

We are the cybersecurity division of [Dunbar Armored](http://www.dunbararmored.com/security-solutions/cybersecurity). We build tools to manage our MSSP platform and contribute these projects for either open or free use.

Our current projects include:

* [Cyphon](https://dunbarcyber.github.io/cyphon/): an incident management and response platform
* [Cyclops](https://dunbarcyber.github.io/cyclops/): SPA that displays real-time data from an instance of Cyphon
